websocket flow
at each step client sends data from particular element to server, server does some work on the data and sends back html content to be put for next step
step 1 - get email, server sends confirmation email, next step will require otp received in email to be entered
step 2 - get otp, server verifies otp, next step will require sending sms with particular code
step 3 - client polls server for update every two seconds, next step would be to get address
step 4 - get address, server saves address, end of flow
